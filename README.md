# web-scraping-challenge
In this challenge, I scraped the Mars news site for titles and previews. I also scraped the Mars temperature data website and created graphs for analysis.

At the beginning of each file, I had to import my ChromeDriverManager and create a path that can follow. I was instructed to do this by my TA, who got the solution from BCS.


I used this specific code from Pablo Jadzinsky when plotting the bar graph for min_temp and the number of months by indicating 'use_index=True'. I was struggling to find a way to plot both the x and the y so they would have a relationship.
